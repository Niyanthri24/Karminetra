**Team:** TechTwist Duo | **Demo Link:** https://karminetra.vercel.app/

## Overview

Karminetra is an AI-powered mobile application designed to empower Indian artisans with low digital literacy to sell their products online. It uses a photo-first, voice-first approach to eliminate technological and language barriers, turning a single photograph into a complete e-commerce listing and allowing store management through simple voice commands in local languages like Kannada.

## Key Features

* **AI-Powered Cataloguing:** Instantly generates a product title, description, keywords, and a fair market price from a single photo using the Gemini API.
* **Voice-First Management:** Artisans can update stock, check orders, and manage their store using natural language voice commands via Dialogflow and the Speech-to-Text API.
* **Multilingual Support:** All generated content and UI elements are available in both English and the artisan's native language.
* **Mini Digital Store:** Automatically creates a shareable, professional-looking store page with a QR code for easy sharing on WhatsApp and social media.

## Technology Stack

* **AI & Machine Learning:**
    * **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash:** For multimodal (image-to-text) catalog generation.
    * **Dialogflow CX & Speech-to-Text/Text-to-Speech:** For the conversational voice assistant.
    * **Google Translate API:** For real-time language translation.
* **Backend & Infrastructure:**
    * **Firebase:** For Authentication (Phone OTP), Firestore (Database), and Storage.
    * **Cloud Functions:** For serverless backend logic.
* **Frontend:**
    * **React & Tailwind CSS:** For a responsive, mobile-first user interface.
